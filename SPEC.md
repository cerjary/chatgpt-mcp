# ChatGPT Computer MCP — Specification

**Status:** Canonical initial specification  
**Protocol target:** MCP `2026-07-28`  
**Runtime:** Node.js 22+, TypeScript, ESM  
**Primary deployment:** private/local computer reachable from ChatGPT through an MCP connection/tunnel

## Human-facing experience and Inspect (owner-approved 2026-09-14)

This maintained specification adopts the interaction principles in the
[Spargax experience/Inspect contract](https://github.com/alexcodeplace/vibeclub/blob/0bd25d33ea614ebcb58b23f33abe25483e2fd634/docs/specs/spargaxos-product.md#experience-and-inspect-contract)
for product-owned human onboarding, settings and graphical management integrations.
This is not a new server UI requirement, protocol session, autonomous planner or
interactive per-tool approval layer. The new presentation behavior is required
but implementation and runtime acceptance are **OPEN**.

**MCP-UX01.** First human-facing product onboarding asks Choose your experience:
Regular / Pro with equal prominence, no preselection, guided versus configurable
setup descriptions, and You can change this anytime in Settings > Experience.
It precedes product account/connection/configuration steps. Pro gets supported
configuration from the beginning, not after a Regular wizard. Store only the
non-secret human presentation preference in its owning installer/management host;
never create implicit MCP client/session state. Noninteractive installation and
machine API calls remain noninteractive, with stable explicit inputs and no new
mandatory UI/account dependency. An integrated surface may inherit an explicitly
chosen host mode; standalone interactive onboarding asks when no choice exists.

**MCP-UX02.** Settings > Experience changes the human interface and help, not
capability grants, endpoint bindings, credential access, command policy, admission
limits, routing, tunnel credentials or a running job/service. Retain drafts and
hidden advanced values; save only deliberately changed settings through the existing
validated configuration authority. Regular and Pro both disclose the actual granted
scope and consequences before a deliberate configuration change. In particular,
the documented broad quick-install configuration must not be called least-privilege
or selected merely because the user chooses Pro. The chosen experience applies to
setup errors, connection verification, maintenance and recovery as well as settings.

### MCP human settings visibility

These rules classify an existing human control or a supported future management
integration, not permission to invent flags, endpoints or unimplemented capabilities.
Pro-only means omitted from Regular editable UI, with a read-only effective summary
and explicit Edit in Pro navigation from settings search/deep links. Existing
owner-authorized CLI/configuration mechanisms remain usable in either mode.

| ID | Regular / common | Pro-only supported configuration |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MCP-S01 Experience / presentation | First choice, mode setting, supported locale/accessibility/help and accurate connection state. | Technical-detail/density preference if supported; no protocol semantics change. |
| MCP-S02 Connection / installation | Guided supported setup, scope review, required secure input, explicit connection test, status and safe update/rollback. | Existing transport/endpoint/tunnel/profile configuration fields. Mode alone changes none of them. |
| MCP-S03 Capability grants | Actual effective scope, risk/consequence explanation and existing guided permission choices or repair. | Detailed allowed roots, executables, services, apps and display grants using the existing validated schema; no bypass or secret reveal. |
| MCP-S04 Execution / limits | Job status, overload explanation, existing authorized cancel and bounded recovery. | Supported command policies, deadlines, concurrency, admission and remote routing configuration. Inspector never executes a probe job. |
| MCP-S05 Credentials / named-key operations | Existing protected enrollment/reference status and owner-owned decision workflow where supported. | Supported reference/adapter configuration; neither mode adds approval authority or replaces the existing broker. |
| MCP-S06 Diagnostics / lifecycle | Safe management diagnostics copy/export, version/health, actual update result and required recovery. | Supported verbosity/retention/backend settings. Existing tool-output contract below is unchanged. |

### MCP inspectable management objects

In an eligible graphical management surface, right-click > Inspect, More actions >
Inspect, Shift+F10/Context Menu key and a visible touch menu open the same read-only
Summary / Details / Evidence panel. The native context menu remains on unrelated
page content, selected text, links, code and editable/secret fields. Opening Inspect
does not launch another tool, shell, test, job, tunnel or service operation.

| ID / eligible item | Safe details and evidence |
| --- | --- |
| MCP-I01 Connection / backend / tunnel status | Safe endpoint/profile identity without credential-bearing URL parts, runtime/protocol version, declared capabilities, observation time and actual readiness/error. Existing status owner only. |
| MCP-I02 Capability / effective policy row | Stable tool/rule identity, allowed scope, configured limits, precedence and source/version from existing parsed configuration. No raw secret environment or unrelated filesystem inspection. |
| MCP-I03 Durable job / operation receipt | Opaque job/operation identity, authorized lifecycle/result, bounded timings, ownership, transport/output limits and safe error code. Raw stdout, file contents, arguments or tool outputs are not automatically copied into the inspector. |
| MCP-I04 Release / install / update receipt | Candidate/active identity, owned paths/resources, verification/rollback evidence and actual result/warnings from the existing lifecycle owner. No deployment from Inspect. |
| MCP-I05 Health / diagnostic / error item | Component/request identity, safe status/failure reason, timestamps/freshness and related authorized objects; no whole-process environment, transcript or credential dump. |
| MCP-I06 Named-key reference / request status | Non-secret name/reference, request identity, pending/approved/denied/expired/execution state and permitted owner-review destination, only through the existing broker adapter. No key value, owner authentication material or approval action. |

The management host obtains an allowlisted, authorized metadata projection from the
existing owner. It must not call a raw data-bearing tool simply to serialize its
entire result into the drawer. Handle denied/stale/unavailable/deleted/late data and
clear inaccessible caches on identity changes. Copy summary, safe field copies and
an explicit inspection-report export require a user action, inclusion preview and
safe output; no automatic upload. Related links reauthorize and navigate to existing
operations rather than mutate from the panel. Keep reads cancellable and bounded.

**MCP-UX03. Verbatim-output boundary.** These inspector projections are a distinct
human management view, not a filter around `fs.read`, `shell.exec`, durable job
output or any other existing MCP result. They do not restore shared output redaction,
block authorized credential use or change the Verbatim tool-output contract below.
The broker's named-key policy and owner decision UI remain separate authorities.
Never mutate an existing result schema to make Regular and Pro look different.

**MCP-A01.** Prove first-choice setup, restart/inheritance/override, settings changes
and hidden-value/draft preservation while a job runs. Test both modes against all
MCP-S rows; noninteractive install/API behavior and effective grants remain unchanged.

**MCP-A02.** Exercise all MCP-I items in the hosting GUI with mouse, keyboard and
touch, native-menu preservation, accessible panel/focus, stale/denied/late data,
safe copy/export and no tool execution. Prove credential values do not enter the
metadata projection while existing authorized verbatim tool-output regression
fixtures still pass without censorship. No new transcript/log collection.

**MCP-A03.** Record each requirement's exact code/release, host/platform/locale,
evidence and gap. Audits repair implementation instead of weakening this maintained
spec or reclassifying missing UI as complete. Current runtime/installation tests do
not prove this new human-interface scope without the mode/Inspect journeys.

Shared-contract adoption is pinned to reviewed revision `0bd25d33ea614ebcb58b23f33abe25483e2fd634`.
The maintained source is `alexcodeplace/vibeclub:docs/specs/spargaxos-product.md`.
When that contract changes, review and update this adoption and the affected local
matrices together; do not silently revert to older mockups or infer new acceptance.

## 1. Purpose

`chatgpt-mcp` is a thin MCP server that gives ChatGPT a controlled, typed interface for taking actions on a computer.

The server is intentionally a protocol adapter, not an orchestration system. ChatGPT decides what action to request; the MCP server validates the request against its exposed capability policy and delegates it to a local `ComputerAdapter` implementation.

The owner decides what the server can do by configuration. The server does not add a second interactive approval workflow of its own.

## 2. Goals

1. Expose useful computer operations to ChatGPT as MCP tools.
2. Use the current stateless MCP protocol (`2026-07-28`) as the canonical protocol contract.
3. Keep protocol transport, tool definitions, policy, and computer implementation separate.
4. Make the first usable deployment require only Node.js plus this repository.
5. Bind network serving to loopback by default so it can be paired with a private tunnel without exposing the machine directly.
6. Permit precise capability restriction by tool, filesystem root, command, service, or application without requiring code changes.
7. Keep all continuity explicit: if an operation needs later continuation, return a handle that a later request supplies explicitly.
8. Keep the MCP layer portable so additional adapters (remote agent, Windows, macOS, container, SSH, etc.) can be added without changing the public tool contract.

## 3. Non-goals

The first version will not:

- implement an autonomous planner or agent loop;
- maintain hidden per-ChatGPT sessions;
- mirror an entire shell protocol into MCP;
- implement an interactive approval UI;
- depend on a public inbound port;
- invent a second RPC protocol between the MCP server and its in-process local adapter;
- promise cross-platform GUI automation in the initial milestone.

## 4. Protocol architecture

### 4.1 Canonical protocol

The canonical protocol revision is MCP `2026-07-28`.

This revision is stateless at the protocol layer:

- no `initialize` / `initialized` handshake is required;
- no `Mcp-Session-Id` is part of the modern protocol contract;
- request identity/capabilities travel with each request;
- every Streamable HTTP JSON-RPC message is its own POST;
- state required by an operation must be represented explicitly rather than stored as implicit MCP session state.

Reference:

- https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2026-07-28
- https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk/blob/main/docs/protocol-versions.md

### 4.2 Primary transport: stateless Streamable HTTP

The primary transport is Streamable HTTP on one `/mcp` endpoint.

Requirements:

- use the MCP TypeScript SDK v2 `createMcpHandler(factory)` serving model;
- create a fresh MCP server instance per request;
- bind to `127.0.0.1` by default;
- accept POST on `/mcp`;
- validate `Origin` when present;
- do not create or depend on protocol sessions;
- do not require sticky routing or shared MCP session storage.

Default endpoint:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:3210/mcp
```

The port is configurable.

### 4.3 Secondary transport: stdio

A stdio entrypoint is provided for local MCP hosts and tunnel clients that spawn a command directly.

It must use the v2 `serveStdio(factory)` entry so modern MCP connections use the 2026 protocol. The same tool factory is shared with HTTP.

Stdio is a transport compatibility option; it must not introduce different tool semantics or hidden state.

### 4.4 Legacy protocol compatibility

The implementation may accept the SDK's stateless legacy compatibility mode where it costs no additional architecture, but all project code is written against the modern `2026-07-28` semantics.

There will be no application code that relies on legacy `initialize`, server-side MCP sessions, unsolicited server-to-client RPC, or `Mcp-Session-Id`.

## 5. Architecture

+---------------------------+
```

### 5.1 Strict seam rule

The MCP package must not mix JSON-RPC/SDK details into the local computer implementation.

`ComputerAdapter` is the internal typed seam. Tool handlers depend on this seam, not on `child_process`, `fs`, desktop commands, or operating-system details directly.

A future adapter swap must not require changing MCP tool names or schemas unless the public capability itself changes.

## 6. Statelessness contract

No correctness-critical mutable state may be associated implicitly with an MCP client/session.

Allowed process state:

- immutable parsed configuration;
- bounded caches that do not alter semantics;
- explicit resource registries keyed by opaque handles returned to the caller, when a capability genuinely represents a long-running OS resource.

If an operation needs continuity, the result must return an explicit handle, for example:

```json
{
  "processHandle": "proc_01J..."
}
```

A later call must provide that handle explicitly. The handle is application state, not an MCP session identifier.

Initial synchronous tools should avoid handles where possible.

## 7. Tool contract

Tool names use a stable dotted namespace. Inputs and outputs are structured and machine-readable. Human-readable text may be included but must not be the only result representation where structured data is practical.

### 7.1 Milestone 1 tools

#### `system.info`

Read basic host/runtime information.

Returns at minimum:

- hostname;
- platform;
- architecture;
- OS release;
- uptime;
- current working directory;
- configured capability summary.

#### `fs.list`

List one directory.

Input:

- `path` — absolute path or path under an allowed root.

Output entries include:

- name;
- type (`file`, `directory`, `symlink`, `other`);
- size where applicable;
- modification time.

#### `fs.read`

Read a text file.

Input:

- `path`;
- optional byte limit.

The implementation must reject files outside configured roots and must cap response size.

#### `fs.write`

Write a UTF-8 text file.

Input:

- `path`;
- `content`;
- optional mode: `create`, `overwrite`, or `append`.

The implementation must reject paths outside configured roots.

#### `fs.mkdir`

Create a directory.

Input:

- `path`;
- optional `recursive` boolean.

#### `fs.move`

Move/rename a filesystem entry.

Input:

- `source`;
- `destination`.

Both sides must be inside configured roots.

#### `fs.delete`

Soft-delete a file or directory by moving it into the managed `.trash/` area in the same logical filesystem workspace.

Input:

- `path`;
- optional `recursive` boolean retained for compatibility; soft deletion moves the target as one filesystem entry.

Output:

- `originalPath`;
- `trashPath`;
- `permanent: false`.

For the local file-safety patch, paths beneath `<configured-root>/mounts/<name>/...` use `<configured-root>/mounts/<name>/.trash/`. Other paths use `<configured-root>/.trash/`.

#### `fs.restore`

Restore an item previously moved by `fs.delete`.

Input:

- `trashPath`.

The Trash path must use a managed timestamp bucket. Restoration reconstructs the original relative path and refuses to overwrite an existing live destination.

#### `fs.purge`

Permanently remove content already inside managed Trash.

Input:

- `path`;
- optional `recursive` boolean.

Live paths outside managed Trash are rejected.

#### `fs.xpurge`

Explicit direct hard-delete escape hatch that bypasses Trash.

Input:

- `path`;
- optional `recursive` boolean;
- `confirm`, which must be exactly `PERMANENT_DELETE`.

Configured filesystem roots and `mounts/<name>` mount roots are protected from this operation.

#### `shell.exec`

Execute one local command and wait for completion.

Input:

- `command` — executable name or path;
- `args` — argument array;
- optional `cwd`;
- optional `env` additions;
- optional `timeoutMs`.

The tool intentionally takes an executable plus argument array rather than a shell command string. The implementation uses direct process spawning with `shell: false` by default.

Output:

- exit code;
- stdout;
- stderr;
- duration;
- timeout flag.

Output size and runtime are bounded by configuration.

#### `process.list`

List visible processes using the host adapter.

Output includes a stable subset where available:

- PID;
- parent PID;
- user;
- command/executable;
- arguments.

#### `process.kill`

Send a signal to a PID.

Input:

- PID;
- optional signal.

### 7.2 Milestone 2 tools

The following are part of the intended public surface but are not required for the first implementation commit:

- `service.status`
- `service.control`
- `app.launch`
- `app.close`
- `browser.open`
- `screen.capture`
- `input.click`
- `input.move`
- `input.type`
- `input.key`

OS-specific behavior for these tools belongs behind `ComputerAdapter` implementations.

### 7.3 Tool annotations

Where the MCP SDK supports tool behavior annotations, tools should accurately declare read-only/destructive/idempotent properties. These annotations are descriptive metadata, not the authorization mechanism.

## 8. Capability policy

Configuration defines the actual authority exposed by one running server.

The MCP tool list should contain only enabled capabilities where practical; disabled capabilities must never execute.

Example configuration shape:

```json
{
  "filesystem": {
    "read": true,
    "write": true,
    "roots": ["/home/alex/projects", "/home/alex/Downloads"],
    "blocklist": [{
      "path": "/home/alex/projects",
      "mode": "freeze-children",
      "message": "Create worktrees under .worktrees/ in the current project."
    }],
    "maxReadBytes": 1048576,
    "maxWriteBytes": 4194304
  },
  "shell": {
    "enabled": true,
    "allowedCommands": ["git", "node", "pnpm", "npm", "python3", "bash"],
    "maxRuntimeMs": 120000,
    "maxOutputBytes": 4194304
  },
  "process": {
    "list": true,
    "kill": true
  }
}
```

`allowedCommands: ["*"]` may be supported as an explicit owner choice.

Desktop-facing authority has a master `desktop.hostDisplayAccess` boolean. Display-dependent tools MUST take an explicit caller-selected X11 `display` value per invocation; the server MUST NOT choose or mutate a process-global `DISPLAY` on their behalf. `app.launch`, `browser.open`, `screen.capture`, `screen.record.start`, and every `input.*` operation pass that display only to the child processes used by that invocation, permitting one MCP server to control multiple X11 displays concurrently without cross-call environment races. The selected display SHOULD be returned in structured tool metadata.
Screen recording is handle-based: `screen.record.start` MUST return without waiting for the recording to finish so the caller can continue interacting with one or more displays, and `screen.record.stop` MUST gracefully finalize the recording before returning file metadata. Recording output MUST be constrained to configured writable filesystem roots and bounded by configured duration, byte-size, and concurrency limits.

Desktop-facing authority has a master `desktop.hostDisplayAccess` boolean. `screen.capture`, desktop input, configured application launch, and configured browser opening require this master grant in addition to their own family flags. When it is denied, shell children must not inherit host graphical-session environment such as `DISPLAY`, `WAYLAND_DISPLAY`, `XAUTHORITY`, `MIR_SOCKET`, or `DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS`, caller-provided environment input must not be allowed to reintroduce those values, and shell policy must reject a maintained defense-in-depth set of obvious host-capture executables and high-signal one-shot capture payloads. The denylist is explicitly not a substitute for OS isolation against arbitrary same-user code execution.

No hard-coded interactive confirmation step is inserted after policy authorization. The permission boundary is the combination of ChatGPT/plugin permissions plus this server's configured capabilities.

## 9. Filesystem path rules

Filesystem access is a trust-boundary concern and must be enforced centrally.

Requirements:

1. normalize and resolve requested paths before use;
2. compare resolved paths against resolved allowed roots;
3. prevent `..` traversal from escaping a root;
4. account for symlinks when accessing existing paths so a symlink cannot silently escape an allowed root;
5. for creation paths, validate the nearest existing ancestor before creation;
6. never duplicate root-check logic independently across tools;
7. apply `filesystem.blocklist` rules after root authorization;
8. `freeze-children` MUST prevent adding, removing, or renaming direct entries of the configured path while allowing ordinary access inside entries that already exist;
9. direct MCP filesystem mutations that could create a path MUST check the nearest existing ancestor so recursive creation cannot skip the protected parent;
10. `freeze-children` MUST NOT implicitly enable local process isolation or change the shell execution backend;
11. direct `mkdir`, `rmdir`, and `rm` shell invocations SHOULD apply the same protected-parent checks to reduce accidental project-root mutation without parsing arbitrary shell languages;
12. GUI, browser, desktop-input, and unrelated shell capabilities MUST remain independently controlled by their own capability settings;
13. `execution.localIsolation.enabled` MUST be the sole switch selecting systemd-isolated local execution;
14. service-manager scope MUST be explicit so user services are controlled through the user manager without polkit elevation;
15. when a blocklist rule contains `message`, direct MCP policy errors MUST return it verbatim.

The filesystem policy implementation is a single reusable module used by every filesystem operation and by `cwd` validation for `shell.exec`. `freeze-children` protects native MCP filesystem mutations and common direct shell directory mutations. It is intentionally a guardrail rather than a kernel security boundary; arbitrary language runtimes and custom wrappers remain governed by the host OS permissions.

## 10. Command execution rules

`shell.exec` uses `spawn`/equivalent with `shell: false` by default.

Requirements:

- executable allow-list is checked before spawn; `*` accepts names and paths, while a restricted list matches the exact requested name/path (never a path's basename);
- `cwd`, when provided, must satisfy configured filesystem/shell roots;
- execution timeout is bounded by server configuration;
- stdout/stderr are bounded to prevent unbounded memory use;
- child termination on timeout is deterministic;
- caller-provided environment entries are merged only when allowed by configuration;
- when host-display access is denied, graphical-session environment is removed from child processes and attempts to provide it explicitly are rejected;
- command result is returned even for non-zero exit status; infrastructure/policy failures use MCP tool errors.

A later explicit `shell.execShell` capability may permit shell-string execution, but it must be separately configurable and must not be silently folded into `shell.exec`.

## 11. Configuration

Configuration precedence:

1. explicit CLI arguments;
2. environment variables;
3. JSON config file;
4. safe defaults.

Initial environment variables:

- `CHATGPT_MCP_CONFIG` — config file path;
- `CHATGPT_MCP_HOST` — HTTP bind host, default `127.0.0.1`;
- `CHATGPT_MCP_PORT` — HTTP port, default `3210`;
- `CHATGPT_MCP_TOKEN` — optional bearer token for the HTTP endpoint;
- `CHATGPT_MCP_LOG_LEVEL` — `silent|error|warn|info|debug`.

Configuration is parsed once at process startup and treated as immutable.

## 12. HTTP boundary

For the local default:

- bind to `127.0.0.1`;
- reject invalid `Origin` headers;
- expose only `/mcp` plus a minimal `/healthz` endpoint;
- never expose directory listings or static files from the HTTP server;
- if `CHATGPT_MCP_TOKEN` is configured, require `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on `/mcp`;
- non-loopback binding must require explicit configuration.

The server must be compatible with being placed behind a private MCP tunnel. Tunnel/auth details are deployment concerns and do not alter tool behavior.

## 13. Errors

Internal seam errors use one structural shape:

```ts
interface ComputerAdapterError {
  code: string;
  message: string;
  operation: string;
  details?: Record<string, unknown>;
}
```

Cross-module checks must use structural guards rather than relying on `instanceof` identity.

Stable initial error codes include:

- `CAPABILITY_DISABLED`
- `PATH_NOT_ALLOWED`
- `COMMAND_NOT_ALLOWED`
- `INVALID_INPUT`
- `NOT_FOUND`
- `TIMEOUT`
- `OUTPUT_LIMIT`
- `OS_ERROR`

MCP tool handlers map these errors to concise tool failures without leaking secrets from configuration or environment variables.

## 14. Logging and observability

Diagnostics go to stderr, never stdout in stdio mode.

Each operation log should include:

- operation/tool name;
- request correlation identifier when available;
- duration;
- outcome/error code;
- non-secret target metadata useful for diagnosis.

Logs must not dump file contents, command output, environment variables, bearer tokens, or arbitrary request bodies by default.

## 15. Project layout

Target layout:

```text
src/
  config.ts
  errors.ts
  policy/
    filesystem.ts
    shell.ts
  adapter/
    computer-adapter.ts
    local-computer-adapter.ts
  tools/
    register-tools.ts
    filesystem.ts
    shell.ts
    system.ts
    process.ts
  server.ts
  http.ts
  stdio.ts

test/
  filesystem-policy.test.ts
  local-adapter.test.ts
  tools.test.ts
  http.test.ts
```

The layout may stay smaller while the implementation is small. Empty/speculative layers must not be created merely to match this diagram.

## 16. Dependencies

Runtime dependencies should remain minimal.

Expected initial dependencies:

- `@modelcontextprotocol/server` v2;
- `@modelcontextprotocol/node` v2 for Node HTTP adaptation if required by the chosen serving implementation;
- `zod` v4 for tool/config schemas.

Node built-ins are preferred for filesystem, process, HTTP, path, and OS operations.

## 17. Testing requirements

Before the first usable release, automated tests must prove at least:

1. server tool discovery exposes enabled tools;
2. disabled tools cannot execute;
3. filesystem reads/writes within a configured temporary root work;
4. traversal outside a root is rejected;
5. symlink escape is rejected;
6. allowed command execution works;
7. disallowed command execution is rejected;
8. timeout terminates a command;
9. output is bounded;
10. modern stateless HTTP can perform independent requests without a session identifier;
11. stdio starts without writing diagnostics to stdout;
12. malformed configuration fails closed at startup.

Tests must use temporary directories/processes and must not modify the developer's real home directory.

## 18. Documentation requirements

`README.md` must explain:

- prerequisites;
- installation;
- configuration;
- starting HTTP and stdio transports;
- connecting from ChatGPT / an MCP tunnel;
- example tool requests;
- how to expand or reduce granted capabilities;
- how to run tests;
- current platform limitations.

`docs/CHATGPT.md` should provide the shortest ChatGPT-specific setup path.

## 19. Milestone-1 acceptance criteria

Milestone 1 is complete when a user can:

1. clone the repository;
2. install dependencies;
3. create a local configuration granting selected roots/commands;
4. start the server on loopback;
5. connect an MCP client using the `2026-07-28` protocol;
6. discover the configured tools;
7. read/write an allowed test file;
8. execute an allowed command;
9. receive a structured result;
10. demonstrate that an out-of-root path and a disallowed executable are rejected;
11. run the automated test suite successfully.

## 20. Design decisions that require a spec change

The following changes are architectural and must update this specification before implementation:

- adding hidden MCP session state;
- changing the canonical MCP protocol era away from `2026-07-28`;
- replacing explicit adapter handles with implicit client/session continuity;
- making a public inbound listener the default deployment;
- changing the public tool namespace/schema incompatibly;
- moving OS-specific logic into MCP handlers instead of the adapter seam;
- adding an internal interactive approval workflow as a mandatory execution step.


## 21. Reliability revision (2026-09-13)

The public protocol remains stateless. Optional durable jobs extend the explicit-handle contract, not the MCP session model. `jobs.enabled` plus a shell grant exposes `exec.start`, `exec.status`, `exec.output`, `exec.cancel`, and `exec.list`. One process-wide job store owns admission for the configured directory. Its executor workers call the existing computer adapter/policy layer and use private persistent reservations and one-time worker claims. No transport error automatically replays a mutation. Worker death or ambiguous launch acknowledgement yields an unknown outcome requiring reconciliation.

Systemd-backed jobs survive backend restarts. The detached launcher does not promise identical service-manager semantics. Output and ledgers have separate bounded retention and capacity; unknown outcomes are not automatically evicted or replayed. Only one active backend submits new work to a job directory. The detailed contract and retention defaults are in `docs/RELIABILITY.md`.

A read+write grant on an adapter implementing `replaceFile` exposes `fs.replace(path, content, expectedSha256)`. It stages and syncs content before atomic replacement, rejects symlinks and frozen directory mutations, and rejects stale hashes. It is not a kernel CAS against non-cooperating writers. Legacy `fs.write` retains its earlier semantics.

`system.info.runtime` includes release identity, loaded configuration fingerprint, process identity and durable-execution availability. New error codes are `CONFLICT` and `OUTCOME_UNKNOWN`; `OVERLOADED` remains capacity pressure, not a permission or tunnel diagnosis. Diagnostics must not contain request arguments, environment values, output or credentials.

Recovery is a separate local supervisor with one locked backend owner and independent per-profile states. It checks fresh MCP capabilities and control-plane polling, never restores permissions/configuration automatically, persists restart budgets before actions, and performs no unconditional restart loop. Deployments share that lock, verify an immutable release inventory, exercise a private candidate, arm an independent rollback timer, and preserve the previous backend's running resources. `docs/DESKTOP-UPDATE.md` defines the local-agent rollout procedure and platform limitations.

## Verbatim tool-output contract (2026-09-14)

Owner requirement: the MCP must not rewrite successful tool results merely because text resembles a credential. Authorized reads and commands return their adapter-produced data unchanged.

1. No shared output-redaction wrapper is applied to registered tools. Textual and structured results, errors, process arguments, URLs, file contents, stdout, and stderr pass through unchanged, subject to normal schema validation, capability checks, byte limits, and transport limits.
2. `fs.read` does not classify or censor credential-looking paths or contents. Files remain accessible only inside explicitly granted filesystem roots and under the existing filesystem policy.
3. `shell.exec` preserves child stdout/stderr exactly as returned by the adapter. Shell authorization, environment policy, runtime/output limits, host-display rules, routing, and isolation behavior are unchanged.
4. Durable workers persist the adapter result without secret-value transformation. `exec.output` paginates the stored stdout/stderr verbatim, including records created before this revision. Request files remain private and are deleted before execution; ledger/output retention and capacity rules are unchanged.
5. Runtime metadata must not claim that output redaction is active. Obsolete `outputRedaction` configuration is not part of the parsed public configuration contract. Existing configuration files containing unknown legacy keys may continue to parse according to the schema's unknown-key behavior, but those keys have no runtime effect.
6. Removing output redaction does not broaden capability grants or disable upstream platform safety controls, OS permissions, filesystem blocklists, shell policy, service allowlists, transport limits, or durable-job privacy permissions.
7. Regression acceptance includes credential-looking file content, stdout, stderr, structured payloads, and durable output surviving the full MCP boundary byte-for-byte while existing authorization and size limits still pass their prior tests.

## Optional named-key operation adapter

The [named-key consumer contract](docs/specs/NAMED-KEY-OPERATIONS.md) defines
the optional deck-kmgr integration. Overdeck owns credential custody, enrollment,
decision UI, and the authenticated Botmaster reply workflow. This MCP exposes
only name discovery, supported operation profiles, typed operation submission,
and durable status. It never obtains provider credentials or owner-decision
authority. The integration is disabled until explicitly enrolled.

This is independent of the verbatim-output contract above: ordinary filesystem
and shell tools are not modified or censored by the key-manager adapter. Its
name-only API projects a defined response schema; it is not a replacement
redaction wrapper around other tools.


## Hot-swappable managed runtime

[Live backend replacement](docs/specs/HOT-SWAP.md) is the owner-directed contract for continuous tunnel/router operation, per-generation ownership, cancellation, rollback and Overdeck host/VM deployment. It supersedes idle-window tunnel cutover for managed backend updates.
